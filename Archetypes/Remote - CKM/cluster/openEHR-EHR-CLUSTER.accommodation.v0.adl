The concepts around housing, accommodation and living arrangements are complex and often potentially overlapping. Within this archetype, the intent of the concept of 'living arrangement' is to capture information about their living situation including, but not limited to, the type of physical accommodation and ownership (or not).

The notion of 'Homelessness' or 'Transient' are often represented in data as a stand-alone Boolean data elements, but should be represented in this archetype as potential values for 'Residential setting'.

This archetype has been designed to be used within the EVALUATION.social_summary archetype, but may be used within any other appropriate ENTRY or CLUSTER archetype related to recording social context.">
