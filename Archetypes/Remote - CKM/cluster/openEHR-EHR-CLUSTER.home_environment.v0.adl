This archetype has been designed to support Australia's NT Hearing Health requirements for recording the presence of a working refrigerator in the home in which to store medications.

In the future, this archetype may be enhanced and extended for other purposes. For example: as part of an occupational therapist's assessment about suitability for a patient to return home.">
