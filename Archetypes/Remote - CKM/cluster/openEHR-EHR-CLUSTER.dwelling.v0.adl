It is anticipated that this archetype will gradually evolve to include structural features within a dwelling that may be useful in assessing the needs of the individual who lives there, for example the presence of stairs or rails.

This archetype has been designed to be used within the EVALUATION.housing_summary archetype, but may be used within any other appropriate ENTRY or CLUSTER archetype related to recording social context.">
