			use = <"Use to record a description of the overall findings observed during the physical examination of sensation of the skin in a specified nerve distribution. This initial draft archetype consists only of the core examination pattern data elements (as per CLUSTER.exam_pattern) and will likely be expanded further over time as specific clinical requirements are identified.

This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination findings' SLOT within the CLUSTER.exam_cranial_nerves, CLUSTER.exam_nerve or CLUSTER.exam_skin archetype, but can also be used within the OBSERVATION.exam and other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording the clinical history about the sensation of the skin - use specific OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom archetypes.">
