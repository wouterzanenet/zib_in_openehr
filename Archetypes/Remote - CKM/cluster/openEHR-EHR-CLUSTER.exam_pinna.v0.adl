			use = <"Use to record a narrative description, structured details and clinical interpretation of the findings observed during the physical examination of external structure of the ears and immediate periauricular region, including scars.

This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination findings' SLOT within the CLUSTER.exam_ears archetype, but can also be used within the OBSERVATION.exam and other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">

Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations or measurements - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.tympanogram_226hz.">
