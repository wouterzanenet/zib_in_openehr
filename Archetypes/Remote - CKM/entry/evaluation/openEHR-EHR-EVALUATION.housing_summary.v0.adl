As housing records, or episodes, are gradually added over time, the Start date' and 'End date' will record the date related to each episode and the 'Last updated' data element will record the last time that the whole summary was updated.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of housing history within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Description' data element.">

Not to be used to record specific details about the housing structure in which an individual lives - use CLUSTER.dwelling nested within SLOTs in this archetype.

Not to be used to record the physical address where an individual lives - use demographic archetypes for this purpose, or CLUSTER.address if the individual's address needs to be recorded within the health record.">
