			use = <"Use to record details about actual consumption of alcohol and associated behaviour at a specified point in time or over an identified period of time.

An alcohol consumption diary could be built up over time by recording the consumption of alcohol on multiple, sequential days - recording actual consumptions using the 'Specified Day' event for each daily entry.

A record of average alcohol use during a period can be recorded by recording the amount of alcohol consumed using the 'Average use' event - the mean use over a specified period of time.

Data that might be used to assess the risk of alcohol abuse or dependence will be recorded using two archetypes: this OBSERVATION archetype (recording the repeatable observations/measurements)  and in the EVALUATION.alcohol_consumption_summary archetype (recording the summary and persisting data).

Binge drinking is not directly referred to in this archetype, yet this archetype will be a key resource used to support the identification of binge drinking through the accurate recording of the amount and frequency of drinking, triggers and social/cultureal context of consumption. The assessment of 'binge drinking' may be recorded as part of a 'Problem List'.">
